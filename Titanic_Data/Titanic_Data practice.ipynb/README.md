# Titanic Disaster - Survival Analysis  

## 🚢 Project Overview  
This project examines Titanic passenger data to identify key factors affecting survival rates.  

## 🛠️ Methods & Techniques  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding survival distribution across different passenger attributes.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Identifying correlations between survival and factors like class, age, and gender.  
- **Machine Learning (Optional):** Using logistic regression to predict survival probability.  

## 📊 Libraries Used  
- pandas, numpy – Data wrangling  
- seaborn, matplotlib – Visualization  
- scikit-learn – Machine learning (optional)  

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **Women and children had a higher survival rate**.  
- **First-class passengers had a significant advantage over lower classes**.  
- **Certain embarkation points had higher survival rates**.  

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- **Enhancing predictive models** using more advanced ML techniques.  
- **Feature engineering** to refine variable importance.
