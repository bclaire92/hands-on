Deloitte Task - Operational Risk Analysis  


Project Overview  
This project aims to identify key operational risk components to enhance risk mitigation strategies. By analyzing various risk factors, the goal is to improve decision-making and optimize business processes.  


Data Analysis Approach 
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize data.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends and risk factors through visualizations.  
- Risk Categorization: Rank risk components based on severity and frequency.  
- Insights & Recommendations: Provide key takeaways for risk mitigation.  


Tools & Libraries Used  
- pandas, numpy – Data manipulation  
- matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization  
- Power BI / Tableau (optional) – Interactive dashboards  


Key Findings  
- The most critical risk components include; 
. Shipping Database - Risk Score: 500.16
. MongoDB Database - Risk Score: 487.35
. AI Engine - Risk Score: 473.86 
- High-risk operations are primarily linked to highest number of down time and interaction frequency.  
- Recommendations include; 
. Enhance monitoring and response systems to quickly identify and address performance issues.
. Optimize AI engine operations to reduce downtime.
. Strengthen security and compliance to the latest data privacy and security regulations, reducing compliance-related risks.
  


Next Steps  
- Further refinement with predictive modeling for risk forecasting.  
- Integration with business intelligence tools for real-time analysis.
